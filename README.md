# City Log -- Front End

## 1. About This Project
In this project, we build a platform for communities to share ideas on what improvements can be made in their city and vote on the best suggestions.
Eventually users would be able to visit the city page and view or upvote all of the requested improvements for each city.
Example: request new restaurant/gym/school, laws that need to be passed, facilities that need to be fixed...

## 4. Getting started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

* First, cd to client folder:

```bash
> cd client
```

* install dependencies

```bash
> npm install
> yarn add
```

* Configure .env file

create a .env.local file in ./cliet folder  

add 'google_api_key = [GOOGLE API KEY]'  

```bash
> npm run dev
```

* start the development server:

```bash
> npm run dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Each .js file in client/pages is mapped to a UI interface, for example, login.js in client/pages is for building login page, to visit it, one way is to visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/login
